# Config Instructions
The configurations file will be stored at `/Users/<username>/.hex/config.json`. It is a json file which can be used to change configurations of how the Hex would work. For example currently you can choose what all pods services you want to see, do you want to see the on-screen instructions if you are new to Hex and if you want to see mock services.
